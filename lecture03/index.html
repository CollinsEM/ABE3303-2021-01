    <h1>Fundamentals of Thermodynamics</h1>
    <h2>Review</h2>
    
    <p>Previously, we gave some examples of how heat and mass
      transport phenomena play a critical role in biological
      systems. We also mentioned a few examples of how we can exploit
      these transport processes to our advantage.</p>
    
    <p>We defined several concepts related to thermodynamics.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Heat sensations (hot and cold) are qualitative assessments
        of <i>relative</i> temperature differences between two objects
        (where one of the objects is typically our skin with
        temperature sensitive nerve endings contained therein).</li>
      <li>Heat energy is a concept used to describe what is being
        transferred from one object to another.</li>
      <li>Thermal kinetic energy is the energy of motion associated
        with the cumulative motions of the particles within a
        system. Note that this typically excludes any kinetic energy
        that might result from the bulk transport of the systems as a
        whole.</li>
      <li>Solid, liquid and gaseous are phases of matter. Changes in
        phase are related to changes in thermal kinetic energy.</li>
      <li>Temperature as a parameterization (quantitative assessment)
        of thermal kinetic energy.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We gave a brief overview of the Laws of Thermodynamics</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>The 0<sup>th</sup> Law of Thermodynamics</strong><br>
        Temperature can be used to establish a framework for
        describing the behavior of thermal kinetic energy in material
        systems. In particular this law establishes thermal
        equilibrium as the steady state condition that results as the
        temperature gradient goes to zero.</li>
      <li><strong>The 1<sup>st</sup> Law of Thermodynamics</strong><br>
        Energy is conserved! In closed systems, the total energy
        content is constant. Energy can change form, but cannot be
        created or destroyed*.</li>
      <li><strong>The 2<sup>nd</sup> Law of Thermodynamics</strong><br>
        Heat energy flows from regions of higher temperature to
        regions of lower temperature.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>We discussed how mass diffusion is also fundamentally the
      result of the random motion of molecules and is driven by thermal
      kinetic energy. Material will typically diffuse from areas of high
      concentration to areas of lower concentration. The random nature
      of particle interactions tends to increase the disorder of a
      system (entropy). The rate of diffusion is related to both the
      magnitude of the concentration gradient as well as the amount of
      thermal kinetic energy present.</p>
    
    <h2>Fundamentals</h2>
    
    <p>Historically, there were two fields of study that resulted in
      our modern understanding of heat and mass transport.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Thermodynamics</strong> is concerned with the
      macroscopic (bulk) behavior of materials and fluids in response to
      changes in temperature. In particular this field led to the
      development of practical heat engines (steam engines,
      refrigeration, etc.).</p>
    
    <p><strong>Statistical Mechanics</strong> is concerned with the
      microscopic behavior of atoms in solids and fluids. From the study
      of the motion of individual atoms and their interactions with
      other atoms, they were able to explain the origin of many of the
      bulk properties of matter that were being measured
      experimentally.</p>
    
    <p>While we will mostly be concerned with thermodynamic processes
      in this course, it is worth it to look briefly at some of the
      results from statistical mechanics to assist with our conceptual
      understanding of these processes and further develop our intuition
      about the thermal behavior of material and biological systems.</p>
    
    <h2>Statistical Mechanics</h2>
    
    <h3>Internal Energy</h3>
    
    <p>It is important to understand where thermal kinetic energy
      resides in materials. Kinetic energy can be sorted into three
      primary categories: translational, vibrational, and
      rotational.</p>
    
    <p>Translation refers to the motion associated with the center of
      mass of an object. Translational kinetic energy is defined in the
      Newtonian sense as:</p>
    <div class="math">
      <span class="mq-float">
        K = \frac{1}{2}mv^2
      </span>
    </div>

    <p>Here, <span class="mq-inline">m</span> is the
      mass of the object
      and <span class="mq-inline">v</span> is the
      translational velocity of the object's center of mass.</p>
    
    <p>Vibration refers to oscillatory motion with respect to some
      location. Vibration is the result of the interplay between an
      object's motion and a conservative potential field exerting a
      central force on the object. The energy in this mode is split
      between kinetic and potential energy. Potential energy typically
      has the form:</p>

    <div class="math">
      <span class="mq-float">
        U = \mathbf{F} \cdot \Delta \mathbf{x}
      </span>
    </div>

    <p><span class="mq-inline">\mathbf{F}</span> is the
      strength of the central force
      and <span class="mq-inline">\mathbf{x}</span> is
      the distance over which the force is applied.</p>

    <p>Rotational energy is stored in the rotational motion of an
      extended body about some fixed axis. Rotational energy typically
      has the form:</p>

    <div class="math">
      <span class="mq-float">
        E_{rot} = \frac{1}{2}I\omega^2
      </span>
    </div>
    
    <p><span class="mq-inline">I</span> is the moment of
      inertia and <span class="mq-inline">\omega</span>
      is the angular velocity (rotational analogs to mass and
      velocity).</p>
    
    <p>Within these three categories, energy can be stored in multiple
      modes. Modes are distinct translational, vibrational, or
      rotational motions. More complex molecules will typically
      possess more of these modes.</p>
    
    <p>For example, a monoatomic substance has only translational
      modes. There are no internal vibrational or rotational
      modes.</p>
    
    <p>A diatomic molecule, on the other hand has an additional
      vibrational mode along the axis joining the atoms and two
      rotational modes about the axes perpendicular to the axis
      joining the two atoms.</p>
    
    <p>From statistical mechanics, we learn that internal energy is
      typically distributed fairly evenly between these modes within
      an individual molecule. That being said, each individual
      molecule within a system may possess differing amounts of
      internal energy. If we examine the behavior of substances with a
      very large number of molecules, it can be shown that the
      distribution of internal energy follows the Maxwell-Boltzmann
      distribution.</p>
    
    <p>If we restrict our attention for the moment to monoatomic ideal
      gases, we see that the internal energy resides solely in the
      translational kinetic energy. Given the Maxwell-Boltzmann
      distribution of this energy, it is possible to relate the
      average kinetic energy to the temperature.</p>

    <div class="math">
      <span class="mq-float">
        \bar{K} = \frac{1}{2} m \bar{v^2} = \frac{3}{2} k T
      </span>
    </div>
    
    <p>Here, <span class="mq-inline">\bar{v}</span> is
      the average particle velocity,
      <span class="mq-inline">k</span> is Boltzmann's
      constant
      <span class="mq-inline">(1.38\cdot10^{-23})</span>
      J/K, and <span class="mq-inline">T</span> is
      the average temperature. Since translational kinetic energy is
      the only mode available for energy to be stored, we can relate
      this quantity to total internal energy by multiplying by the
      number of particles in the system.</p>

    <div class="math">
      <span class="mq-float">
        U = N (\frac{3}{2} k T) = n N_A (\frac{3}{2} k T) = \frac{3}{2} n R T
      </span>
    </div>
    
    <p>Here, <span class="mq-inline">N = n N_A</span> is
      the number of atoms in the
      system, <span class="mq-inline">n</span> is the
      number of
      moles, <span class="mq-inline">N_A</span> is
      Avogadro's
      number <span class="mq-inline">(6.022\cdot10^{23}</span>
      mol<sup>-1</sup>), and <span class="mq-inline">R =
        k N_a</span> is the universal gas constant (8.314 J/mol K).</p>

    <p>One other thing we can obtain from the average kinetic energy
      is the average velocity of the monoatomic atoms in this ideal
      gas. The root mean square (rms) speed is given by:</p>

    <div class="math">
      <span class="mq-float">
        v_{rms} = \sqrt{\bar{v^2}} = \sqrt{\frac{3 k T}{m}}
      </span>
    </div>
    
    <h3>Heat Energy</h3>
    
    <p>During the early study of thermodynamics, it was believed that
      there was a substance transferred between objects that was
      responsible for the changes in temperature. This caloric fluid
      concept was later replace by the notion of <strong>heat
      energy</strong>. To distinguish heat energy from thermal kinetic
      energy, we will be using thermal kinetic energy to describe the
      amount of heat energy present in the system (or a portion of it)
      and heat energy to refer to the transfer of thermal kinetic
      energy from one location to another (or one portion of the
      system to another).</p>
    
    <h3>Specific Heat</h3>

    <p><strong>Specific heat</strong> is the amount of energy required
      to raise the temperature of a given quantity of material by a
      given temperature increment.</p>

    <div class="math">
      <span class="mq-float">
        c_P = \frac{1}{m} \frac{\Delta Q}{\Delta T}
      </span>
    </div>
    
    <p>This quantity can vary with pressure, temperature, and
      density. For solids and liquids specific heat is measured under
      constant pressure conditions. Although there is some temperature
      dependence in these measurements, they are typically very
      small. For the purposes of this course, we will assume that the
      specific heat for liquids and solids is roughly constant over
      the temperatures and pressures we will be working with.</p>
    
    <p>For gases, the situation is more complex. There are two
      specific heats that are typically measured; one under constant
      pressure
      conditions, <span class="mq-inline">c_P</span> ,
      and the other under constant volume conditions,
      <span class="mq-inline">c_V</span> . These values
      often have a more significant dependence on temperature. In our
      problem sets we will explicitly state if this temperature
      dependence is significant enough to consider and provide the
      relevant formulas for computing specific heat in those
      circumstances.</p>
    
    <p>One <strong>calorie</strong> is the amount of heat energy
      required to raise one gram of water by one degree Celsius (or
      Kelvin) at 20 degrees Celsius and one atmosphere of pressure. In
      SI units this is 4.186 J.</p>
    
    <p>One food Calorie is actually 1000 calories (1 kcal).</p>
    
    <p>The equation above can be rearranged to give us a formula for
      relating heat energy transfer to change in temperature.</p>

    <h3 style="text-align: left;">State and Rate Variables</h3>
    
    <p>State variables describe the instantaneous state of a portion of the system at a specific location (or region).</p>
    <ul>
      <li>State variables are often measured directly or computed from other state variables.</li>
      <li>State variables can also be expressed as integrals of rate variables.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Rate variables describe the change in state variables with respect to time or location.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Rate variables are often expressed as derivatives of state variables.</li>
      <li>We can also use finite differences as approximations to derivatives</li>
    </ul>
